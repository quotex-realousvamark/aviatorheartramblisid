## What is Halal?

Halal is an Arabic term that means "permissible" or
"lawful". In Islam, halal refers to anything that is allowed or
permitted under Islamic law, including food, drink, clothing, and
activities.

## Is Quotex Halal?

The answer to this question is not entirely straightforward. There are
some scholars who believe that Quotex is halal, while others believe
that it is haram, or forbidden.

The main argument against the permissibility of Quotex is that it
involves gambling. Gambling is considered haram in Islam because it
involves betting money on an uncertain outcome.

However, some scholars argue that Quotex is not gambling because it is
based on skill and knowledge. Traders who are successful in Quotex are
able to make informed decisions about which assets to trade and when to
trade them.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the question of whether Quotex is halal is a matter of
personal opinion. There is no clear consensus on the issue, and traders
should make their own decisions based on their own understanding of
Islamic law.
